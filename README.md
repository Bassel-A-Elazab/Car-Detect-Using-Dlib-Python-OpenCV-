# Car-Detect-Using-Dlib-Python-OpenCV-

# Introduction 
 * Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. <br>
 * For creating an object detector we use here good way called HOG+SVM that there're very popular and best known for their  performance.
 * It's easy to understand The Histogram of Oriented Gradients [HOG](https://www.learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients/) and Support Vector Machines [SVM](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/ml/introduction_to_svm/introduction_to_svm.html) but it's difficult to build it from scratch and we use this good api called [dlib](http://dlib.net/)
